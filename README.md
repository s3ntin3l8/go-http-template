# Go HTTP Template

A minimal Go backend template using `net/http` (stdlib), structured config, and
full CI/CD via reusable workflows from
[`s3ntin3l8/.github`](https://github.com/s3ntin3l8/.github).

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```sh
make install-hooks   # set up pre-commit + pre-push hooks
```

### 2. Development

```sh
make build           # compile all packages
make test            # run tests with race detection
```

### 3. Run the server

```sh
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
go run ./cmd/server -config ./config.yaml
```

The server listens on the address from `config.yaml` (default `:8080`) and
exposes a `/health` endpoint.
